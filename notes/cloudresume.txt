~ AWS S3 and AWS CloudFront Notes
- caches your content/files.  Creates super fast responses
- if the material isn't cached, it will retrieve it from the origin and then sets it cached in an edge location
- also leverage the AWS global private network; provides better performance for both static and dynamic content.
